# 📘 Execution Plan

> 🎯 **Core idea: A "learn by doing" platform for people who want to build real, hands-on experience**

* 🏆 Challenge: Untapped | Engineering the Future of Learning (Future Work)

---

## 1. 👥 Target Users

| User | What they have in common |
|------|--------------------------|
| 🎓 Students | Lack practical experience and have no workplace to practise in |
| 🔄 Career changers | Lack practical experience in their new field |

* 📚 Platform purpose: **learning**, not recruitment

---

## 2. 😣 Pain Points

| Pain point | Description | Evidence |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| 📉 Learners don't finish online courses | Overall MOOC completion rates are around 15% or lower | Jordan (2015) |
| 🧍 Learning alone, with little interaction | Low completion is often attributed to low learner interaction | Dolata et al. (2019) |
| 🧭 Requires strong self-discipline | Learners with stronger self-directed learning skills complete more of the course | Schulze (2014) |
| 🧩 Knowledge isn't applied | Watching videos and answering quizzes is not the same as doing real work | Challenge brief |

**💥 If this isn't solved**
* 🧑‍🎓 People without experience can't find a way in, and their skills fall behind
* 🏢 Companies can't find new hires with practical experience
* 🌏 Strong self-learners pull further ahead while others fall behind, widening the gap

---

## 3. 🔄 User Flow

1. 🧠 **Career assessment**
   * The user completes a career assessment
   * A **simple result** is shown: "You're a good fit for [field]"
   * A short AI explanation is included: why this field fits, and how it connects to the recommended projects
2. 🤖 **AI project matching**
   * Projects are recommended based on the assessment result
3. 🙋 **User chooses a project**
   * Projects are provided by industry mentors and are **based on realistic workplace scenarios** (avoiding confidentiality issues)
4. 🤝 **Team completes tasks**
   * Each project is broken into tasks that users complete together
   * A **Contribution form** records each member's contribution
5. 🧑‍🏫 **Mentor guidance**
   * Mentors set the **Criteria** (the standards of their field)
   * AI helps generate tasks and give task feedback
   * Mentors guide throughout, without over-intervening
6. 📊 **AI personal analysis**
   * When a project or milestone is completed, AI gives personalised advice based on mentor feedback and the user's work
   * The standard comes from the mentor's Criteria
7. 🔗 **Ask AI anytime**
   * During a project, users can ask AI to recommend relevant external courses

## 4. 🎭 Roles

| Role | What they do | What they get |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 🧑‍🎓 Learner | Chooses projects, completes tasks, records contributions | Practical experience, personalised advice |
| 🧑‍🏫 Mentor | Provides projects, sets Criteria, guides | Company exposure |
| 🏢 Company | Sends mentors, provides scenarios | Brand exposure |
| 🤖 AI | Matching, task generation, feedback, analysis, course recommendations | N/A |

---

## 5. 🧩 Design Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Users **choose** their own project | People are more motivated by what they choose, similar to graduate programs that let trainees pick what they work on |
| Use **realistic scenarios**, not real company projects | Avoids company confidentiality issues |
| Mentors set Criteria, **AI delivers** feedback | Mentors don't need to personally guide every team, so one mentor can support more learners and the platform can run long term |
| Mentors can't see a user's identity until they're interested in their work | Reduces bias, so evaluation is based only on the work |
| Assessment shows a **simple result + AI explanation** | Users understand why they were recommended a project, so they trust the matching |
| No penalty for free-riding | The platform doesn't recruit or grade, so free-riding only cheats yourself; users are here to learn |

---

## 6. ⚠️ Known Limitations and Assumptions

* 🙋 **Assumption:** Users genuinely want to learn
* 🚌 **Limitation:** Free-riders may still hold back committed teammates
* 📏 **Limitation:** The quality of AI feedback depends on how well mentors write their Criteria
* 🏢 **Limitation:** Each mentor represents the standards of their company or field, not the whole industry
* 🐣 **Limitation:** Early on, there will be few mentors, so project choice will be limited

---

## 7. 🛠️ MVP Scope (Day 3)

| Type | Content |
|------|---------|
| ✅ Built | Browse and choose projects, task board, Contribution form, AI task feedback (based on Criteria) |
| 🎭 Simulated | Career assessment and project recommendations, login, demo data |
| 🎨 Mockup (Slide 3) | Full user flow diagram, AI personal analysis, course recommendations |

* 🏷️ The presentation will **clearly label** what is built and what is simulated

**Tech Stack**
* Frontend & Backend: Next.js (React)
* Database: Firebase Firestore
* AI: Claude API
* Design: Figma
* Deployment: Vercel
* Collaboration: GitHub

## 8. 🏆 Marking Criteria

| Criteria | Weighting | Our argument |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Potential Effectiveness | 40% | Realistic projects + peer collaboration + mentor standards directly address three pain points: knowledge not applied, learning alone, and low motivation |
| Technical Feasibility | 30% | The MVP focuses on project features; everything else is simulated and clearly labelled |
| Originality | 15% | Learners do projects instead of watching courses; AI amplifies mentors instead of replacing them |
| Viability | 10% | Companies gain exposure; AI reduces mentors' time cost so the platform can run long term |

⚠️ Weightings add up to 95%; the remaining 5% needs to be confirmed with the organisers

---

## 9. 📌 Untapped Focus Areas

* **A. AI Tutors and Learning Companions:** AI feedback, AI personal analysis, course recommendations
* **D. Simulations and Virtual Environments:** Projects based on realistic workplace scenarios
* **E. Collaborative Learning:** Team tasks, peer collaboration
